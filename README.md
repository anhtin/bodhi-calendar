# Bodhi Calendar (Vietnamese Edition)

Vietnamese lunisolar calendar for checking whether you should be a vegetarian
today or not.


## Motivation

Some lay-followers of Buddhism are _intermittent vegeterians_. This means that
they avoid eating meat on certain days during the year. Vietnamese buddhists
typically use the Vietnamese lunar calendar to determine their _vegetarian
days_. However, their civic calendar is usually a solar one. As such, it can be
difficult to keep track of their vegetarian days.


## Intended Audience

This web app was created with Vietnamese buddhists in mind. As such, the
Vietnamese calendar is used instead of the Chinese calendar or any other
variants.
