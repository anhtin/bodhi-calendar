# Bodhi Calendar v2

Keep track of which days you need to be a vegetarian based on buddhist
beliefs. The calendar highlights relevant days in green for you to get an
overview of the month and plan your diet accordingly. This web application is
a rework of the old [Bodhi Calendar](https://github.com/anhtin/bodhi-calendar).
