# Bodhi Calendar

Keep track of which days you need to be a vegetarian!

Lay-followers of Buddhism may choose to follow a vegetarian schedule, where
they refrain from eating meat on specific days of the year. One problem,
however, is that these days are dictated by the lunar calendar, which makes
it difficult for those who are only accustomed to follow the lunar calendar
in their day-to-day life. As such, the goal of this web application, _Bodhi
Calendar_, is to help such followers with keeping track of the vegetarian
dates.
