# Bodhi Calendar (Vietnamese Edition)

Keep track of your vegetarian days!


## Motivation

Some lay-followers of Buddhism are _partial vegeterians_. This means that they
avoid eating meat on very specific days of the year. These days, however, are
largly determined by some variant of the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

Vietnamese buddhists typically use the Vietnamese lunisolar calendar to
determine their _vegetarian days_. However, their civic calendar is usually a
solar one, e.g. the Gregorian calendar. As such, it can be difficult to keep
track of their vegetarian days.

Additionally, many lay-followers also struggle with remembering which lunisolar
dates are considered as vegeterian days. It doesn't help that there are 
discrepancies in practice between partial vegetarians. Luckily enough, if you
just selected a set of vegetarian days, their occurence follow a strict and
predictable monthly pattern.


## Intended Audience

This web app was designed with Vietnamese buddhists in mind. As such, the
Vietnamese calendar is used instead of the Chinese calendar or any other
variants. In the future, a new version of the app might support multiple
variants - if such a need presents itself.
